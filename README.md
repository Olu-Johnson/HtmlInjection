# HtmlInjection
HTML Injection is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when untrusted data is inserted into an HTML web page without proper sanitization or validation. This can lead to the execution of malicious code or unintended modifications to the web page's content and structure.

Causes of HTML Injection:
1. Insufficient Input Validation: Failure to validate user input properly allows attackers to inject malicious HTML code into web forms, input fields, or query parameters.
2. Lack of Output Encoding: Failing to encode user-generated content before displaying it on a web page allows the HTML and JavaScript code to be interpreted by the browser.
3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities: HTML Injection is often associated with Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities, where an attacker injects malicious scripts that are executed by other users visiting the affected page.

Prevention of HTML Injection:
1. Input Validation and Sanitization: Implement robust input validation techniques to ensure that user input meets the expected format and restrictions. Apply input sanitization to remove or escape any HTML tags or characters that could be interpreted as code.
2. Output Encoding: Always encode user-generated content before displaying it on a web page. Use proper output encoding techniques to convert special characters into their HTML entity equivalents, preventing the browser from interpreting them as code.
3. Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a Content Security Policy to restrict the types of content that can be loaded and executed on your web pages. This helps prevent the execution of injected scripts by specifying allowed sources for scripts, stylesheets, and other resources.

This 3 prevention are limited to this article, there are more ways in which you can prevent HTML injection.

By implementing these preventive measures, you can significantly reduce the risk of HTML Injection vulnerabilities and protect your web application from potential attacks.
